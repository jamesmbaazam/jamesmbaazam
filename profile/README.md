Hi there :wave:, welcome to my GitHub account. 

**Research**

I am trained to use mathematical models and computer simulations to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of infectious vaccine-preventable diseases. Find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=IxRpXp8AAAAJ&hl=en)

In 2020, I was featured in a [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2020/07/29/will-coronavirus-measures-slow-measles-ask-this-ghanaian/#3e42ef9860c2) on whether mitigation measures mounted against the covid19 pandemic would impact measles outbreaks. The article also talks about my background. 

I am a 2018 Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (DARA) Big Data Policy Fellow. During the fellowship, I was trained in identifying the policy implications of scientific research, and how to use commnication media such as policy briefs to communicate these implications to policy-makers. 

**My other interests**

- I am passionate about science and policy communication, and do pursue collaborations in that area (check out some of my publications on the list on my profile).
 
- I am interested in Data Science and the methods for learning from data. 

**Hobbies**

- I occasionally blog at www.jamesazam.com
- I have a [YouTube channel](https://lnkd.in/ey-YZiz) (over 2.5k subscriptions) with tutorials on academic and research tools like Mendeley, JabRef, Rayyan, etc.
