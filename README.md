Hi there :wave:, welcome!! 

I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, working on the [EpiVerse](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative funded by [data.org](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/). I am interested in developing software for scientific research, and am a member of the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/). 

**Software Projects**

I am currently working to improve[bpmodels](https://github.com/sbfnk/bpmodels) in terms of user-friendiness: improved features, speed, and documentation. `bpmodels` is an R package that provides methods for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains generated from branching processes.

The package will soon be submitted to CRAN. Be on the lookout for this.


**Research interests**

I am a trained - PhD awarded - infectious disease modeller. I use computer simulations to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of infectious vaccine-preventable diseases. However, more broadly, I am interested in quantitative research that improves the health outcomes. 

To add to this, I like indulging in the science communication and science policy literature. 

You can find my work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=IxRpXp8AAAAJ&hl=en).
