## About me

üïê: I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine, working on the [Epiverse TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative, 
which is a project to develop and maintain R packages for providing reproducible analytics 
support during epidemics. 

üïê: I also co-maintain the Carpentries course on [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson).

üíª: I use R, git and Github daily.

üñ•Ô∏è: I am slowly learning Bayesian Data analysis and [Rstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) through 
the [Statistical Rethinking course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus).

üë®‚Äçüíº: My current role involves developing/maintaining R packages for real-time forecasting of 
infectious disease outbreaks. 

‚öôÔ∏è: I am interested in developing software/workflows/pipelines for sustainable and reproducible outbreak analytics, 
and am a member of the [Society of Research Software Engineering, UK](https://society-rse.org/). 

## Current work

üì¶: Developing [epichains]("https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains") as a successor of [bpmodels]("https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels"), which is an 
R package for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains. 
üíª: Contributing to the development of other packages in the [Epiverse]("https://github.com/epiverse-trace/").

* Day-to-day tasks: 
    - improving the underlying models of the packages I develop and maintain,  
    - employing best practices of software development:
       - friendly and professional code reviews,
       - improving code coverage with well-crafted unit tests,
       - adding continuous integration and other workflows,
       - improving documentation, 
       - making it easy to contribute to projects, etc.   

## Research

### Ongoing work:

1Ô∏è‚É£: [Age-structured compartmental model](https://github.com/SACEMA/sa-polio-model) for 
estimating the timing of detection of polio-related acute flacid paralysis in South 
Africa (generalizable to other settings).
    - Workflow: R and GNU make.
    
2Ô∏è‚É£: [A surveillance pipeline](https://github.com/SACEMA/severity-monitoring) to detect 
changes in reported COVID-19 severity (case fatality, case hospitalization, and 
hospital fatality).
    - Workflow: R and GNU make.
    
3Ô∏è‚É£: [A systematic review](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/orv_modelling_review_epidemics) 
of outbreak response mechanistic modelling practices before the COVID-19 pandemic for 
human vaccine-preventable diseases.
    - Workflow: R, Rmarkdown, and LaTeX.
    
4Ô∏è‚É£: [A two-strain compartmental model](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/two_strain_orv_model) 
for studying the impact of the timing of emergence of variants on control strategies.
    - Workflow: R (but will be refactored soon to use GNU make too).

### Broad research interests:

1Ô∏è‚É£: Compartmental modelling of the impact of control measures against 
infectious diseases. 

2Ô∏è‚É£: Models and methods for (near) real-time forecasting of infectious diseases. 

3Ô∏è‚É£: _More recently_: Models and methods for analysing early outbreak data, including 
informing contact tracing, and inferring who infected whom in outbreaks. I am exploring the software 
ecosystem around this area to see how I can contribute. If you have any pointers, I would be 
happy to hear about them.

## Teaching

I don't currently teach as part of my duties but I can teach the following topics quite comfortably:

1Ô∏è‚É£: R programming from the basics to advanced topics (R package development, object-oriented programming)

2Ô∏è‚É£: Git/GitHub from the basics to intermediate/advanced (merging and rebasing, cherry-picking, etc)

3Ô∏è‚É£: Reproducible data analysis workflows

4Ô∏è‚É£: Mathematical/Statistical/Dynamical modelling of infectious diseases

5Ô∏è‚É£: Various topics in data analysis

6Ô∏è‚É£: Thesis and journal article writing techniques
