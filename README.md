## About me

üïê: I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine, working on the [Epiverse TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative, 
which is a project to develop and maintain R packages for providing reproducible analytics 
support during epidemics. 

üíª: I use R, git and Github daily.

üë®‚Äçüíº: My current role involves improving/developing R packages for real-time forecasting of 
infectious disease outbreaks. 

‚öôÔ∏è: I am interested in developing software/workflows/pipelines for reproducible outbreak analytics, 
and am a member of the [Society of Research Software Engineering, UK](https://society-rse.org/). 

## Software Projects

üì¶: I am currently maintaining [bpmodels](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels), which is an 
R package for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains. 

* My day-to-day tasks include: 
    - refactoring the code base to adopt object-orientation (S3 classes and methods), 
    - including the simulation of other types of branching processes and  linelists, 
    - adding methods to handle and visualize simulated transmission chains, 
    - speeding up the simulation runtimes, and 
    - improving documentation. 

## Research

### Ongoing work:

1Ô∏è‚É£: [Age-structured compartmental model](https://github.com/SACEMA/sa-polio-model) for 
estimating the timing of detection of polio-related acute flacid paralysis in South 
Africa (generalizable to other settings).
    - Workflow: R and GNU make.
    
2Ô∏è‚É£: [A surveillance pipeline](https://github.com/SACEMA/severity-monitoring) to detect 
changes in reported COVID-19 severity (case fatality, case hospitalization, and 
hospital fatality).
    - Workflow: R and GNU make.
    
3Ô∏è‚É£: [A systematic review](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/orv_modelling_review_epidemics) 
of outbreak response mechanistic modelling practices before the COVID-19 pandemic for 
human vaccine-preventable diseases.
    - Workflow: R, Rmarkdown, and LaTeX.
    
4Ô∏è‚É£: [A two-strain compartmental model](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/two_strain_orv_model) 
for studying the impact of the timing of emergence of variants on control strategies.
    - Workflow: R (but will be refactored soon to use GNU make too).

### Broad research interests:

1Ô∏è‚É£: Compartmental modelling of the impact of control measures against 
infectious diseases. 

2Ô∏è‚É£: Models and methods for (near) real-time forecasting of infectious diseases. 

3Ô∏è‚É£: _More recently_: Models and methods for analysing and informing contact tracing, 
and for inferring who infected whom in outbreaks. I am exploring the software 
ecosystem around this area to see how I can contribute. If you have any pointers, I would be 
happy to hear about them.
