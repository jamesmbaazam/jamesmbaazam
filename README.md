Hi there :wave:!! 

## About me

I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, working on the [Epiverse TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative. 

I am interested in developing software for scientific research, and am a member of the [Society of Research Software Engineering, UK](https://society-rse.org/). 

My current role involves improving/developing R packages for real-time forecasting of infectious disease outbreaks. 

## Software Projects

I am currently improving [bpmodels](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels), which is an R package for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains. Improvements include: 
- refactoring the core base to adopt object-orientation, 
- including the simulation of other types of branching processes and  linelists, 
- adding methods to handle and visualize simulated transmission chains, 
- speeding up the simulation runtimes, and 
- improving documentation. 

## Research

- I am interested in: 
    - modelling the use of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to control infectious diseases. 
    - tooling - developing opensource software - of outbreak response data analytics. 
    - science communication and policy.
