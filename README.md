Hi there, I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine, working on the [Epiverse TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative, 
which is a project to develop and maintain R packages for providing reproducible analytics 
support during epidemics.

# What I do

üì¶: Develop and maintain [epichains](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains) as a successor of [bpmodels](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels) (an 
R package for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains)

üì¶: Contribute to the following R packages:

  - Several packages in the [Epiverse-TRACE Initiative](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/),
  - [EpiNow2](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2),
  - [epinowcast](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast),
  - [scoringutils](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/).

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Code reviews. See examples in:
  - [the epidemics R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epidemics/pull/176#pullrequestreview-1925558435)
  - [the cfr R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cfr/pull/78#pullrequestreview-1617135290)
  - [the superspreading R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading/pull/77#pullrequestreview-1833259711)
  - [the epiparameter R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/pull/341#pullrequestreview-2161323012)

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Peer review scientific manuscripts in Infectious disease modeling, Global Public Health, and R package development.

  - I've so far reviewed articles in [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/), [Plos Global Public Health](https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/), and [The Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/).
