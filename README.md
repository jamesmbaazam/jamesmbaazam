I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine, working on the [Epiverse TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative, 
which is a project to develop and maintain R packages for providing reproducible analytics 
support during epidemics.

I am interested in developing mathematical and statistical models and methods and accompanying software to improve our understanding of how pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions impact disease spread.

# What I do

üì¶: **Develop** epidemiological modelling R packages:
  - [epichains](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains), an R package for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains), and 
  - [EpiNow2](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2), an R package for forecasting and nowcasting infectious disease dynamics and estimating the time-varying reproduction number.

üì¶: **Contribute** to the following R packages:

  - Several packages in the [Epiverse-TRACE Initiative](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/),
  - [epinowcast](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast),
  - [scoringutils](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/).

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: **Conduct code reviews**. See examples in:
  - [the epidemics R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epidemics/pull/176#pullrequestreview-1925558435)
  - [the cfr R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cfr/pull/78#pullrequestreview-1617135290)
  - [the superspreading R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading/pull/77#pullrequestreview-1833259711)
  - [the epiparameter R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/pull/341#pullrequestreview-2161323012)

üë®‚Äçüè´: **Teach** (not officially). For example,
  - For the "Modelling for Pandemic Preparedness and Response" modular short course on behalf of the [German West African Center for Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention in Ghana](https://g-wac.org/). See my materials [here](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/intro-to-idd-modelling) and [here](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/mppr).
  - My [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesAzam)

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Peer review scientific manuscripts in Infectious disease modeling, Global Public Health, and R package development.

  - I've so far reviewed articles in [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/), [Plos Global Public Health](https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/), [The Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/), and [Bulletin of Mathematical Biology](https://link.springer.com/journal/11538)).

üåê: Collaborate & Affiliate with several networks including:
  -  The [Global Burden of Disease Network](https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/gbd) as a collaborator,
  -  [South African Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis](https://www.sacema.org/) as a [Research Associate](https://www.sacema.org/person/james-azam-phd/),
  -  [German West African Center for Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention in Ghana](https://g-wac.org/) as an infectious disease analytics fellow.
