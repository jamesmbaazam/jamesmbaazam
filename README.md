Hi there, I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine, working on the [Epiverse TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative, 
which is a project to develop and maintain R packages for providing reproducible analytics 
support during epidemics.

### What I do

📦: Develop [epichains](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains) as a successor of [bpmodels](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels), which is an 
R package for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains.

📦: Contributor: [EpiNow2](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2), [epinowcast](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast), and [scoringutils](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/).

📦: Contribute to the packages in the [Epiverse-TRACE Initiative](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/).

🕵️‍♂️: Code reviews. See examples in:
  - [the epidemics R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epidemics/pull/176#pullrequestreview-1925558435)
  - [the cfr R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cfr/pull/78#pullrequestreview-1617135290)
  - [the superspreading R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading/pull/77#pullrequestreview-1833259711)

🕵️‍♂️: Peer review of scientific manuscripts in Global Health, Epidemiology, and infectious disease modeling, and R software.
