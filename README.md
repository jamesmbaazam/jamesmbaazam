Hi there :wave:!! 

## About me

I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, working on the [Epiverse TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative, which is a project to develop and maintain R packages for providing reproducible analytics support during epidemics. 

I use R, git and Github daily.

My current role involves improving/developing R packages for real-time forecasting of infectious disease outbreaks. 

I am interested in developing software/workflows/pipelines for reproducible scientific research, and am a member of the [Society of Research Software Engineering, UK](https://society-rse.org/). 

## Software Projects

I am currently improving [bpmodels](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels), which is an R package for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains. 

- Improvements include: 
    - refactoring the code base to adopt object-orientation (S3 classes and methods), 
    - including the simulation of other types of branching processes and  linelists, 
    - adding methods to handle and visualize simulated transmission chains, 
    - speeding up the simulation runtimes, and 
    - improving documentation. 

- There are plans to develop a class and methods to handle transmission chains across several packages.


## Research

### Ongoing work:

- [Age-structured compartmental model](https://github.com/SACEMA/sa-polio-model) for estimating the timing of detection of polio-related acute flacid paralysis in South Africa (generalizable to other settings).
    - Workflow: R and GNU make.
- [A surveillance pipeline](https://github.com/SACEMA/severity-monitoring) to detect changes in reported COVID-19 severity (case fatality, case hospitalization, and hospital fatality).
    - Workflow: R and GNU make.
- [A systematic review](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/orv_modelling_review_epidemics) of outbreak response mechanistic modelling practices before the COVID-19 pandemic for human vaccine-preventable diseases.
    - Workflow: R, Rmarkdown, and LaTeX.
- [A two-strain compartmental model](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/two_strain_orv_model) for studying the impact of the timing of emergence of variants on control strategies.
    - Workflow: R (but will be refactored soon to use GNU make too).

### General interests:

- Developing compartmental models for studying the impact of control measures against infectious diseases. 
- (Near) real-time forecasting of infectious diseases. 
- Science communication and policy.
