Hi there :wave:!! 

I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, working on the [EpiVerse](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative funded by [data.org](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/). I am interested in developing software for scientific research, and am a member of the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/). 

**Software Projects**

I generally work on Pillar 2 of the Epiverse-TRACE Initiative, which involves improving/developing available tools/R packages for real-time forecasting of infectious disease outbreaks. Currently, I am actively improving [bpmodels](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels), which is an R package for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains. In terms of improvements, I'm adding more simulation models, the ability to visualize the simulated transmission chains, faster runtimes, and documentation. `bpmodels` package will soon be submitted to CRAN. Be on the lookout for this.


**Research interests**

I am a trained - PhD awarded - infectious disease modeller interested in evaluating the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of infectious vaccine-preventable diseases. More broadly, I am interested in quantitative health data analytics and tooling as an outcome, not a nice-to-have. 

Additionally, I indulge in the science communication and science policy literature.
