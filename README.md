## About me

🕐: I am a Research Software Engineer :computer: at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine, working on the [Epiverse TRACE](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) Initiative, 
which is a project to develop and maintain R packages for providing reproducible analytics 
support during epidemics. 

🕐: I also co-maintain the Carpentries course on [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson).

💻: I use R, git and Github daily.

🖥️: I am slowly learning Bayesian Data analysis and [Rstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) through 
the [Statistical Rethinking course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus).

👨‍💼: My current role involves developing/maintaining R packages for real-time forecasting of 
infectious disease outbreaks. 

⚙️: I am interested in developing software/workflows/pipelines for sustainable and reproducible outbreak analytics, 
and am a member of the [Society of Research Software Engineering, UK](https://society-rse.org/). 

## Current work

📦: Developing [epichains](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains) as a successor of [bpmodels](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels), which is an 
R package for analysing the distribution of the size and length of transmission chains.

📦: Contributing to new features and enhancements of [EpiNow2](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2).

📦: Contributing to the development of other packages in the [Epiverse](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/).

🕵️‍♂️: Reviewing open source R code.

🕵️‍♂️: Peer reviewing R software, epidemiologic, and epidemic modeling papers.

### Day-to-day tasks

* Improving the underlying models of the packages I develop and maintain,  
* Employing best practices of software development:
  - friendly and professional code reviews,
  - improving code coverage with well-crafted unit tests,
  - adding continuous integration and other workflows,
  - improving documentation, 
  - making it easy to contribute to projects, etc.   

## Research

### Recently completed

1️⃣: Azam, J.M., Pang, X., Are, E.B., Pulliam, J.R. and Ferrari, M.J., 2023. [Modelling outbreak response impact in human vaccine-preventable diseases: A systematic review of differences in practices between collaboration types before COVID19](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2023.100720). Epidemics, p.100720.

### Ongoing work

1️⃣: [Age-structured compartmental model](https://github.com/SACEMA/sa-polio-model) for 
estimating the timing of detection of polio-related acute flacid paralysis in South 
Africa (generalizable to other settings).
    
2️⃣: [A surveillance pipeline](https://github.com/SACEMA/severity-monitoring) to detect 
changes in reported COVID-19 severity (case fatality, case hospitalization, and 
hospital fatality).
    
3️⃣: [A two-strain compartmental model](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/two_strain_orv_model) 
for studying the impact of the timing of emergence of variants on control strategies.

### Broad research interests:

1️⃣: Compartmental modelling of the impact of control measures against 
infectious diseases. 

2️⃣: (Bayesian) Models and methods for (near) real-time forecasting and nowcasting of infectious diseases. 

## Teaching

I don't currently teach as part of my duties but I can teach the following topics quite comfortably:

1️⃣: R programming from the basics to advanced topics (R package development, object-oriented programming)

2️⃣: Git/GitHub from the basics to intermediate/advanced (merging and rebasing, cherry-picking, etc)

3️⃣: Reproducible data analysis workflows

4️⃣: Mathematical/Statistical/Dynamical modelling of infectious diseases

5️⃣: Various topics in data analysis

6️⃣: Thesis and journal article writing techniques
